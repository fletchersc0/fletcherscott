        <!-- Single-column bio text -->
        <div class="bio-text">
          <p>The goal of my research is to understand how people learn and revise beliefs when time, attention, and computation are limited, and to use this understanding to design learning-optimal sequences of information. I compare cases when learners begin with similar versus varied prior beliefs, asking how these starting points shape what ordering of items produces the greatest learning with the least effort.</p>
          <p>My current case study is political messages and news items, especially content that can mislead or provoke strong emotion. Using large-scale online experiments, I manipulate sequence features and measure when people shift their level of attention from intuitive judgments to focused deliberation, and how beliefs change in response.</p>
          <p>To do so, we define computational models that compute an exposure history and use it to adjust the influence of each cue on later judgements. The hypothesis is that such models can capture human behaviour because people are resource-rational when making inferences about credibility. People want to attain a strategy that functions well across information environments and so they achieve this by storing coarse predictive categories, utilized when the context is unclear. The noteworthy problem is that these coarse representations appear to regard stereotypes about the speaker, their motivations and what political or social groups they belong to.</p>
          <p>The problem this addresses relates to the fact that algorithmic feeds now structure much of human information access. Different feeds expose people to different statistical environments, including those that frequently surprise to those that consistently affirm. These environments evidently modulate attention and memory, and noise (inconsistency, distraction, or volatility), and, in a way that we do not currently understand, increase cognitive load and degrade efficiency. We formalize these environments under a set of rules, with the aim of embedding learner models into information systems and enable adaptive placement of corrections or explanations at their most effective moment.</p>

        <h2>When order shapes belief: sequence design for bounded agents (2025)</h2>
        <p>People rarely encounter information in isolation. Instead, they encounter it through algorithmic feeds that embed items within sequences and contexts that shape their salience, credibility, and integration with prior beliefs. We argue that human learning from recommender systems and the ways it may differ, can be understood by considering credibility as a computational problem of inference over time. The learner must identify reliable cues and sources, allocate attention, and update beliefs under constraints, which constitutes a computational problem that the human learner is optimized to detect and exploit. We claim that this problem acquires a rough solution from three fundamental control systems that the brain uses to maximize functioning across two desirable but competing performance dimensions: speed-accuracy, stability-flexibility, and generalization-multitasking. If improvements on one predictably degrades the other, then sequences that push the system toward speed, stability, or divided attention should yield predictable biases in belief updating. These trade-offs shape belief updating under sequenced exposure and serve to explain common findings in the misinformation and digital persuasion literature.</p>

        <h2>Making accuracy easier: credibility perceptions as a latent cause assignment problem (2025)</h2>
        <p>The challenge of identifying reliable content amid widespread falsehoods requires a capacity for well-calibrated credibility judgments. We propose that humans address this challenge using statistical learning-the same cognitive process that helps us acquire language and recognize patterns. However, this adaptive mechanism may backfire in algorithmically curated information environments, leading to increased polarization and susceptibility to misinformation. We first outline a latent-cause model of credibility perception, which broadly describes the impact of structure learning, allowing people to categorize information based on recurring patterns (source identity, emotional tone, in-group signals) and then use these categories as shortcuts when evaluating new information. While this process is cognitively efficient, it can make users more vulnerable to misinformation that matches their learned patterns and more resistant to corrections that violate them. We present a Bayesian framework linking environmental statistics to belief formation, propose three testable predictions, and outline experimental protocols for studying these phenomena in controlled settings.</p>

        <h2>Offgrid Online: Visualizing the Environmental Cost of Everyday Computation (2025)</h2>
        <p>Offgrid Online is a browser extension that visualizes the environmental cost of everyday digital activity. Every time a user searches the web or uses AI tools, it impacts a digital forest, trees are cut down, and a furnace burns, measuring the energy and environmental resources consumed. The forest reflects a user's digital footprint in real time. But users are also empowered to counteract this by donating to ecological charities, and so they can regenerate their forest and watch trees grow back, skies clear, and wildlife return. This project acts as a participatory artwork, interactive data visualizer, and behavioural feedback tool. Offgrid Online visualizes emissions and ties restoration to everyday behaviour. The result is a responsive forest that makes people's environmental data personal and changeable.</p>

        <h2>Papyrus (2025)</h2>
        <p>The scholarly record is increasingly fragmented: more than four million peer-reviewed papers now appear each year, yet mismatched metadata, discipline-specific jargon, and paywalls hinder efficient discovery. When the volume of information overwhelms a finite capacity, researchers must either spend months undertaking cross-disciplinary syntheses or retreat into an ever-narrower niche, fueling professional fatigue and the well-documented reasoning errors that accompany cognitive overload.</p>
        <p>We re-frame this crisis as a tractable machine-learning problem. Transformer-based language models embed full-text articles in a shared semantic space, while citation graphs add complementary topological cues. Together these representations can automatically surface convergent findings, flag near-replications, and spotlight neglected intersections. Each of these tasks currently overwhelm manual review. Layering an adaptive recommender that infers a reader's evolving goals yields the benefit of passive discovery of high-utility papers as well as an explicit push toward serendipity, both measurable with standard ranked-retrieval and diversity metrics.</p>
        <p><em>Papyrus</em> is a desktop and mobile platform that atomises every article into fine-grained Units of Knowledge, or minimal, context-free propositions expressed in subject-predicate-object form. Each Unit inherits its parent article's embedding, enabling intra-paper summarisation and inter-paper synthesis through a two-stage pipeline (predicate-argument extraction followed by cosine-similarity clustering). Granularity adapts to expertise: novices see high-level explanatory Units, while domain experts receive technical Units that reveal citation pathways and unresolved contradictions.</p>

        <h2>Dataset Sentiment Classifier for Experimental Stimuli (2025)</h2>
        <p>A new protocol is emerging in misinformation research that aims to improve the rigor of stimulus design. But pretesting statements for emotional or categorical content is often costly and places an undue burden on participants, who have to repeatedly evaluate large sets of stimuli simply to verify that they meet predefined criteria.</p>
        <p>As a preliminary solution, machine learning offers a promising route for approximating human-like text perceptions. I've developed a simple tool on Kaggle that allows researchers to upload a dataset of statements and receive outputs categorizing each one by emotional sentiment and its intensity. Essentially, it serves as a user-friendly interface for psychological researchers without a technical background, providing access to a sentiment classifier without requiring extensive coding.</p>
        <p>Warning: this method has not yet been validated against established psychological measures at the time of writing. Perhaps a future PhD project could take this further? Someone, pick it up!</p>

        <h2>The role of conflict and alignment in shaping responses to polarizing factchecks (2024)</h2>
        <p>People often continue to endorse claims after fact-checks (the continued influence effect, CIE). Dominant accounts attribute CIE to a failure to detect conflict between prior beliefs and corrective evidence, or because, once they do notice, they respond in a reactive partisan-consistent way. In a 2×2 (Congruence × Truth) online experiment with N=200 Australian adults, we measured participant evaluations at two levels: rapid associations (Brief Implicit Association Test; BIAT) and normative judgments (self-report). We predicted that larger implicit–explicit discrepancies (IED) would magnify partisan-congruent processing if an identity-protective form of dissonance dominated. Contrary to prediction, while perceptions of statements were clearly shaped by partisanship and fact-checking robustly predicted belief updating, IED did not reliably moderate the degree of belief updating. Instead, higher overall source liking, indicated by alignment across measures, broadly dampened corrective shifts irrespective of congruence, suggesting that coherent intuitions about both preferred and nonpreferred sources set the weight of correction, not conflict between them. This pattern is consistent with conflict being registered at the statement–evidence level while source-level discrepancy remained inert. We propose that to increase item-level accuracy, corrections should generally suppress identity coactivation and keep sources peripheral so that judgments anchor themselves in statement-evidence coherence.</p>

        <h2>PhD Proposal — Impact of Information Environments on the Perception of Credibility (2024)</h2>
        <p>Relevance and credibility are shaped by the information environments people inhabit and the noise they encounter. Information environments range from feeds that consistently surprise the user to those that consistently affirm them, each altering attention and memory systems in distinct ways. Previous research has shown that noise, defined as inconsistent or distracting information, can disrupt attention, increase cognitive load, and reduce efficiency.</p>
        <p>As algorithms increasingly become the main source of information globally, it is essential to investigate how the structure these algorithms impose on information affects the way individuals maintain and revise their beliefs, accounting for the varying presence of noise in these feeds. Understanding how these varying environments impact perception is key to unraveling the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in human-information interaction.</p>
        <p>The primary aim of this topic is to explore the relationship between different information environments and their impact on perceptions of credibility. Specifically, it seeks to investigate how various sequences affect information processing and beliefs regarding the specific information being sequenced. This is to examine the potentially disruptive effects of noise during credibility judgements and maintenance of states of cognitive control.</p>
        <p>Previous research has revealed adaptive strategies employed by the meta-cognitive system in noisy environments. But as of yet, it is unknown whether these strategies are also utilized in algorithmically sequenced news information, potentially explaining key findings in studies of misinformation and the susceptibility of people to polarized narratives when such narratives confirm existing beliefs. These investigations seek to contribute to the body of literature tasked with developing strategies to moderate credibility perception in diverse information settings.</p>
